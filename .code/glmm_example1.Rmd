# Scenario

A plant pathologist wanted to examine the effects of two different strengths of
tobacco virus on the number of lesions on tobacco leaves.  She knew from pilot
studies that leaves were inherently very variable in response to the virus.  In
an attempt to account for this leaf to leaf variability, both treatments were
applied to each leaf.  Eight individual leaves were divided in half, with half
of each leaf inoculated with weak strength virus and the other half inoculated
with strong virus.  So the leaves were blocks and each treatment was represented
once in each block.  A completely randomised design would have had 16 leaves,
with 8 whole leaves randomly allocated to each treatment.

tobacco <- read_csv('../public/data/tobacco.csv', trim_ws = TRUE)
glimpse(tobacco)
```


# Exploratory data analysis

<div class='HIDDEN'>

The response here represents the average number of lesions across a number of
microscope views within a section of leaf.  As such, provided the averages are
sufficiently far from 0, there is no a priori reason to suspect that the data
would not follow a Gaussian distribution.

</div>

Model formula:
$$
y_i \sim{} \mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \sigma^2)\\
\mu_i =\boldsymbol{\beta} \bf{X_i} + \boldsymbol{\gamma} \bf{Z_i}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ and $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ are vectors of the fixed
and random effects parameters respectively and $\bf{X}$ is the model matrix
representing the overall intercept and effects of the treatment on the number of
lesions.  $\bf{Z}$ represents a cell means model matrix for the random
intercepts associated with leaves.

<div class='HIDDEN'>

We will start by explicitly declaring the categorical variable (TREATMENT) as a
factor.  In addition, random effects (in this case LEAF) should also be declared
as factors.

```{r tobaccoEDA1, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, hidden=TRUE}
tobacco <- tobacco %>%
  mutate(LEAF = factor(LEAF),
         TREATMENT = factor(TREATMENT))
```

To explore the assumptions of homogeneity of variance and normality, a boxplot
of each Treatment level is appropriate.

```{r tobaccoEDA2, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, hidden=TRUE}
ggplot(tobacco,  aes(y=NUMBER,  x=TREATMENT)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

**Conclusions:**

- both normality and homogeneity of variance seem satisfied

It can also be useful to get a sense of the consistency across blocks (LEAF).
That is, do all Leaves have a similar baseline level of lesion susceptibility
and do they respond similarly to the treatment.

```{r tobaccoEDA3, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, hidden=TRUE}
ggplot(tobacco,  aes(y = NUMBER,  x = as.numeric(LEAF))) +
  geom_line(aes(linetype = TREATMENT))

## If we want to retain the original LEAF labels
ggplot(tobacco,  aes(y = NUMBER,  x = as.numeric(LEAF))) +
  geom_blank(aes(x = LEAF)) +
  geom_line(aes(linetype = TREATMENT))
```

**Conclusions:**

- it is clear that some leaves are more susceptible to lesions (e.g. Leaf 7)
  than other leaves (e.g. Leaf 4)
- most leaves (other than Leaf 4 and 6) have a similar response to the
  Treatments - that is most have higher number of lesions from the Strong
  Treatment than the Weak Treatment.

Given that there are only two levels of Treatment (Strong and Weak), it might be
easier to visualise the differences in baselines and effect consistency by
plotting as:

```{r tobaccoEDA4, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, hidden=TRUE}
ggplot(tobacco,  aes(y = NUMBER, x = TREATMENT,  group = LEAF)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(x = as.numeric(TREATMENT))) 
```

**Conclusions:**

- this figure reiterates the points made earlier about the varying baselines and
  effect consistency.

The above figure also serves as a good way to visualise certain aspects of mixed
effects models.  When we fit a mixed effects model that includes a random
blocking effect (in this case LEAF), we are indicating that we are allowing
there to be a different intercept for each block (LEAF).  In the current case,
the intercept will represent the first Treatment level (Strong).  So the random
effect is specifying that the intercept can vary from Leaf to Leaf.

We can think of the model as having two tiers (a hierarchy), where the tiers of
the hierarchy represent progressively smaller (typically) spatial scales.  In
the current example, the largest spatial units are the leaves (blocking factor).
Within the leaves, there are the two Treatments (Strong and Weak) and within the
Treatments are the individual observations.

We tend to represent this hierarchy upside down in the model formula:

$$
y_i \sim{} \mathcal{N}(\mu_i, \sigma^2)\\
\mu_i =\beta_0 + \boldsymbol{\beta} \bf{X_i}\\
\beta_0 = \boldsymbol{\gamma} \bf{Z_i}
$$

In addition to allowing there to be a different intercept per leaf, we could
allow there to be a different magnitude of effect (difference between Strong and
Week Treatment) per leaf.  That is considered a random slope. From the figure
above, there is some evidence that the effects (slopes) may vary from Leaf to Leaf.

Incorporating a random slope (in addition to a random intercept), may reduce the
amount of unexplained variance and thus improve the power of the main effect
(Treatment effect).

# Fit the model {.tabset .tabset-faded}

<div class='HIDDEN'>

As with Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMM)
are fitted using maximum likelihood.  However, for models containing random
effects, maximum likelihood estimates are known to be biased.  To correct this
bias, rather than use maximum likelihood, we can use Residual Maximum Likelihood
(REML).  REML maximises the likelihood of the residuals instead of maximising
the likelihood of the observed data.

## lme (nlme)

```{r fitModel1a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, hidden=TRUE}
## Fit the random intercepts model
tobacco.lme <- lme(NUMBER ~ TREATMENT,  random = ~1|LEAF,  data = tobacco,  method = 'REML')
## Fit the random intercepts/slope model
tobacco.lme1 <- lme(NUMBER ~ TREATMENT,  random = ~TREATMENT|LEAF,  data = tobacco,  method = 'REML')
```

Having now fit the two models (a random intercept model and a random
intercept/slope model), we can use AIC (or AICc) to determine which model is 'best'.

```{r fitModel1b, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, hidden=TRUE}
AICc(tobacco.lme,  tobacco.lme1)
```

**Conclusions:**

- on the basis of AICc, we would conclude that the random intercepts model is
  the best (it had the lowest AICc).  Technically, both AICc values were within
  2 units of each other and therefore where not considered significantly
  different.  We would therefore chose models on the basis of complexity (lower
  complexity, the better).  Therefore, we would chose the random intercepts
  model (if has the fewer used degrees of freedom).
  
Alternatively, we could use a likelihood ratio test (LRT).

```{r fitModel1c, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, hidden=TRUE}
anova(tobacco.lme,  tobacco.lme1) %>% print
```

**Conclusions:**

- there is no inferential evidence that the two models are different from one
another, hence we would go with the simplest model (`tobacco.lme` - the random
intercepts model). 

## lmer (lme4)

```{r fitModel2a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, hidden=TRUE}
## Fit the random intercepts model
tobacco.lmer <- lmer(NUMBER ~ TREATMENT + (1|LEAF),  data = tobacco, REML = TRUE)
## Fit the random intercepts/slope model
## Note the following could not be run in lmer as there was not enough observations
## to estimate all of the effects and random effects.
## tobacco.lmer1 <- lmer(NUMBER ~ TREATMENT + (TREATMENT|LEAF),  data=tobacco, REML=TRUE)
## tobacco.lmer1 <- lmer(NUMBER ~ TREATMENT + (TREATMENT|LEAF),  data=tobacco, REML=TRUE,
##                       control = lmerControl(
##                           check.nobs.vs.nRE = "ignore",
##                           optimizer = 'optim',
##                           optCtrl = list(method = 'BFGS'))
##                       )
```

If we had been able to fit both models (the random intercept model and the random
intercept/slope model), we could have used AIC (or AICc) to determine which
model is 'best'.  As it is, we only have the random intercepts model.

```{r fitModel2b, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, hidden=TRUE}
#AICc(tobacco.lme,  tobacco.lme1)
```
  
Similarly, we could have used a likelihood ratio test (LRT).

```{r fitModel2c, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, hidden=TRUE}
#anova(tobacco.lme,  tobacco.lme1) %>% print
```

## glmmTMB (glmmTMB)

Optimizers include:

- `nlminb` (non linear optimiser)
- `Nelder-Mead` - robust but relatively slow
- `BFGS` - quasi-Newton method (acronym of authors) - gradient based
  - fast, but less robust as requires function to be differentiable
- `L-BFGS-B` - as above but with different constraints
- `SANN` - simulated annealing - relatively slow

`glmmTMB` uses the `nlminb` (nonlinear minimizer)

```{r fitModel3a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, hidden=TRUE}
## Fit the random intercepts model
tobacco.glmmTMB <- glmmTMB(NUMBER ~ TREATMENT + (1|LEAF),
                           data = tobacco, REML = TRUE)
## Fit the random intercepts/slope model
## Note the following model did not converge - probably due to insufficient data.
tobacco.glmmTMB1 <- glmmTMB(NUMBER ~ TREATMENT + (TREATMENT|LEAF),
                            data = tobacco, REML = TRUE)
## Try a different optimizer (BFGS)
tobacco.glmmTMB1 <- glmmTMB(NUMBER ~ TREATMENT + (TREATMENT|LEAF),
                            data = tobacco, REML = TRUE,
                            control = glmmTMBControl(optimizer = 'optim',
                                                   optArgs='BFGS'))
                                                   ## optArgs = 'Nelder-Mead'))
```

If we had been able to fit both models (the random intercept model and the random
intercept/slope model), we could have used AIC (or AICc) to determine which
model is 'best'.  As it is, we only have the random intercepts model.

```{r fitModel3b, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, hidden=TRUE}
AICc(tobacco.glmmTMB,  tobacco.glmmTMB1)
```
  
Similarly, we could have used a likelihood ratio test (LRT).

```{r fitModel3c, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, hidden=TRUE}
anova(tobacco.glmmTMB,  tobacco.glmmTMB1) %>% print

### ggpredict
There is a rather obtuse issue with `ggpredict`. Due to downstream processing
(using `predict()`), models fit with data in the form of a tibble will not work.
In order to use `ggpredict` on a `lme` model, it is necessary to ensure that the
data are `data.frame`.  We can simply update the model..

```{r partialPlots1c, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, hidden=TRUE}
tobacco.lme1 <- update(tobacco.lme, data=as.data.frame(tobacco))

<div class='HIDDEN'>
Given that there was only two levels of a single predictor, the only follow up
analysis might be to explore hypotheses around effects of specific magnitudes.
For example, we could investigate whether the strong inoculation treatment
increases the number of lesions by over a specific amount.  For this example,
lets explore the likelihood that the Strong treatment could result in an
increase in lesions of over 2 (on average) compared to the Weak treatment.

## lme (nlme) {.tabset .tabset-pills}

### glht

```{r prediction1a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
tobacco.lme %>% multcomp::glht(linfct=c('TREATMENTWeak=-2')) %>% summary
```

**Conclusions:**

- there is evidence that the Strong treatment does result in a more than 2 unit
  increase in the number of lesions.

### hypothesis

```{r prediction1b, cache=TRUE, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
## lme not supported
#brms::hypothesis(tobacco.lme, 'TREATMENTWeak < -2')
```


## lmer (lme4) {.tabset .tabset-pills}

### glht

```{r prediction2a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
tobacco.lmer %>% multcomp::glht(linfct=c('TREATMENTWeak=-2')) %>% summary
```

**Conclusions:**

- there is evidence that the Strong treatment does result in a more than 2 unit
  increase in the number of lesions.

### hypothesis

```{r prediction2b, cache=TRUE, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
tobacco.lmer %>% brms::hypothesis('TREATMENTWeak < -2')
```
**Conclusions:**

- there is very strong evidence (Post.Prob = 1) that the Strong treatment does
  result in a more than 2 unit increase in the number of lesions.


## glmmTMB (glmmTMB) {.tabset .tabset-pills}

### glht

```{r prediction3a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
tobacco.glmmTMB %>% multcomp::glht(linfct=c('TREATMENTWeak=-2')) %>% summary
```

**Conclusions:**

- there is evidence that the Strong treatment does result in a more than 2 unit
  increase in the number of lesions.

### hypothesis

```{r prediction3b, cache=TRUE, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
## Does not appear to work for glmmTMB?
                                        #brms::hypothesis(tobacco.glmmTMB, 'TREATMENTWeak < -2')
```
