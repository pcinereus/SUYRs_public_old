# Scenario

In an honours thesis from (1992), Mullens was investigating the ways that cane
toads ( Bufo marinus ) respond to conditions of hypoxia. Toads show two
different kinds of breathing patterns, lung or buccal, requiring them to be
treated separately in the experiment. Her aim was to expose toads to a range of
O~2~ concentrations, and record their breathing patterns, including parameters
such as the expired volume for individual breaths. It was desirable to have
around 8 replicates to compare the responses of the two breathing types, and the
complication is that animals are expensive, and different individuals are likely
to have different O~2~ profiles (leading to possibly reduced power). There are
two main design options for this experiment;

-   One animal per O~2~ treatment, 8 concentrations, 2 breathing types.  With 8
    replicates the experiment would require 128 animals, but that this could be
    analysed as a completely randomised design
-   One O~2~ profile per animal, so that each animal would be used 8 times and
    only 16 animals are required (8 lung and 8 buccal breathers)

Mullens decided to use the second option so as to reduce the number of animals
required (on financial and ethical grounds). By selecting this option, she did
not have a set of independent measurements for each oxygen concentration, by
repeated measurements on each animal across the 8 oxygen concentrations.

**BREATH**     Categorical listing of the breathing type treatment (buccal = buccal breathing toads, lung = lung breathing toads). This is the between subjects (plots) effect and applies to the whole toads (since a single toad can only be one breathing type - either lung or buccal). Equivalent to Factor A (between plots effect) in a split-plot design
**TOAD**       These are the subjects (equivalent to the plots in a split-plot design: Factor B). The letters in this variable represent the labels given to each individual toad.
**O2LEVEL**    0 through to 50 represent the the different oxygen concentrations (0% to 50%). The different oxygen concentrations are equivalent to the within plot effects in a split-plot (Factor C).
**FREQBUC**    The frequency of buccal breathing - the response variable
**SFREQBUC**   Square root transformed frequency of buccal breathing - the response variable

# Exploratory data analysis

Model formula:
$$
y_i \sim{} \mathcal{Pois}(\lambda_i)\\
ln(\lambda_i) =\boldsymbol{\beta} \bf{X_i} + \boldsymbol{\gamma} \bf{Z_i}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ and $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ are vectors of the fixed
and random effects parameters respectively and $\bf{X}$ is the model matrix
representing the overall intercept and effects of copper, distance and their
interaction on the number of number of worms.  Area of the place segment was
also incorporated as an offset.  $\bf{Z}$ represents a cell means model matrix
for the random intercepts associated with individual plates.

<div class='HIDDEN'>
In this example, the individual `TOAD`s are the random blocks.  Each toad can only
be of one `BREATH` type (they are either predominantly buccal breathers or
predominantly lung breathers).  Hence, `BREATH` is a between `TOAD` (block)
effect.  The frequency of buccal breathing of each `TOAD` was measured under
eight different oxygen levels and thus, these represent the within block effect,
as will the interaction between breathing type and oxygen level.

The response in this case is a little tricky since it is a proportion, but
without the full original measurements.  For example a frequency of 50% would
indicate that half of the breaths taken by the toad during the monitoring phase
were buccal breaths.  Ideally, it would be good to have the actual counts (both
the number of buccal breaths and the total number of breaths).  That way, we
could model the data against a binomial distribution.

As it is, we only have the proportion (as a percentage).  Although we could
model this against a beta distribution, this could be complicated if there are
proportions of either 0 or 1 (100).

To help guide us through this and the other typical model assumptions, lets
start by graphing the frequency of buccal breathing against breathing type and
oxygen level.  However, before we do, we need to make sure that all categorical
variables are declared as factors (including the random effect). If we intend to
model against a beta distribution, we will need a version of the response that
is represented on a scale between 0 and 1 (but not include 0 or 1).

```{r dataPreparation, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, hidden=FALSE}
mullens <- mullens %>%
  mutate(BREATH = factor(BREATH),
         TOAD = factor(TOAD),
         pBUC = FREQBUC/100,
         pzBUC = ifelse(pBUC == 0,0.01,pBUC))
```

So starting with the raw response.

```{r eda1a, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, hidden=FALSE}
ggplot(mullens,aes(y = FREQBUC, x = factor(O2LEVEL), color = BREATH)) +
    geom_boxplot()
```

**Conclusions:**

- there is a very clear relationship between mean and variance (boxplots that
  are higher up the y-axis are taller).
- it might be possible to address this via a logarithmic or root transformation,
  however this is the least favourable option (particularly root transformations
  due to issues with back-transformations).

If we intend to use a beta distribution, we could repeat the above with the
scaled response.  Since the rescaling maintains the same ranking and relative
spacing, the plot will look the same as above, just with a different y-axis.
However, our interpretation will change.  Under a beta distribution (with logit
link), we expect that the variance and mean will be related.  We expect that the
distributions will become more varied and more symmetrical as the expected mean
shifts towards 0.5.  Distributions approaching 0 and 1 will be more asymmetrical
and smaller.  This indeed does seem to be the case here.

Now lets explore the oxygen trends (separately for each breathing type).

```{r eda1b, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, hidden=FALSE}
ggplot(mullens,aes(y = pzBUC, x = O2LEVEL, color = BREATH)) +
    geom_smooth() +
    geom_point()
```

**Conclusions:**

- although linearity seems reasonable for the buccal breathers, there is
definitely evidence of non linearity in the lung breathers.
- it might be interesting to fit polynomial trends for oxygen concentration.


```{r eda1c, results='markdown', eval=TRUE, hidden=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=7}
ggplot(mullens,aes(y = pzBUC, x = O2LEVEL, color = BREATH)) +
    geom_smooth() +
    geom_point() +
    facet_wrap(~BREATH+TOAD, scales = 'free')
##facet_grid(TOAD~BREATH)
```

**Conclusions:**

- it does appear that different toads (within the same breathing type) have very
different levels of buccal breathing
- the individual toads also have varying responses to changes in oxygen
  concentration
- it might be useful to explore random intercept/slope models.

**Conclusions:**

- the more complex random intercept/slope model failed to converge.
- essentially this is because the negative log-likelihood surface does not have
  a discernible trough (minimum).  Instead it is either flat or monotonically
  declining.  Hence the optimiser has not identified a minimum (other than at
  the end of the surface).
- this is usually because the model is over-parameterised (too complex for the
  amount of data available).
- it can also be due to random effects (or dispersion or zero-inflation) that
  are estimated to be zero.
- for Bayesian models we could tighten the priors and try refitting, but for
  Frequentest models, there is no alternative but to proceed with the more
  simple model.

**Conclusions:**

- these parameter estimates are on a logit (log odds/odds ratio scale)
- the estimated proportion of buccal breathing in the buccal breathing toads at an oxygen
  concentration of 0 is `r round(as.numeric(mullens.tidy[1, 5]), 2)` (on the logit
  scale).  This equates to an odds of breaths being buccal (when the toad is a
  buccal breather in 0% oxygen) of `r round(exp(as.numeric(mullens.tidy[1,5])),2)`:1 -

The results so far suggest that the relationship between buccal breathing
frequency and oxygen concentration is different for buccal breathers compared to
lung breathers.  We also know that there is strong evidence for a linear trend
for the buccal breathers.  It would therefore be interesting to specifically
test whether there is evidence for either a linear or quadratic trend for the
lung breathers.

## OR
mullens.lmer1a %>% emtrends(specs = 'BREATH',  var = 'O2LEVEL',  max.degree = 3,  infer = c(TRUE, TRUE))

mullens.grid %>%
    group_by(BREATH) %>%
    summarise(value  =  O2LEVEL[which.max(emmean)])
```

**Conclusions:**

- the rate of buccal breathing by buccal breathing toads declines linearly with
  increasing oxygen concentration
- the rate of buccal breathing by lung breathing toads as oxygen concentration
  increases follows a quadratic trend.  Initially, as oxygen concentrations
  increases, the rate of buccal breathing increases up to an oxygen
  concentration of approximately 20 percent, after which it declines.
