# Scenario

An ecologist studying a rocky shore at Phillip Island, in southeastern Australia, was interested in how
clumps of intertidal mussels are maintained [@Quinn-1988-137]. In particular, he wanted to know how densities of adult
mussels affected recruitment of young individuals from the plankton. As with most marine invertebrates,
recruitment is highly patchy in time, so he expected to find seasonal variation, and the interaction
between season and density - whether effects of adult mussel density vary across seasons - was the aspect
of most interest.

The data were collected from four seasons, and with two densities of adult mussels. The experiment
consisted of clumps of adult mussels attached to the rocks. These clumps were then brought back to the
laboratory, and the number of baby mussels recorded. There were 3-6 replicate clumps for each density
and season combination.

quinn <- read_csv('../data/quinn.csv', trim_ws = TRUE)
quinn %>% glimpse()
quinn %>% summary()
```

```{r dataprep, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
quinn <- quinn %>%
  mutate(SEASON = factor(SEASON,
                         levels = c('Spring', 'Summer', 'Autumn', 'Winter')),

# Exploratory data analysis

Model formula:
$$
\begin{align}
y_i &\sim{} \mathcal{NB}(\lambda_i, \theta)\\
ln(\mu_i) &= \boldsymbol{\beta} \bf{X_i}\\
\beta_0 &\sim{} \mathcal{N}(0,10)\\
\beta_{1,2,3} &\sim{} \mathcal{N}(0,2.5)\\
\theta &\sim{} \mathcal{Exp}(1)
\end{align}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ is a vector of effects parameters and $\bf{X}$ is a model matrix representing the intercept and effects of season, density and their interaction on mussel recruitment.

**Conclusions:**

- we see that the range of predictions is fairly wide and the predicted means could range
  from 0 to very large (perhaps too large).

### Defining priors {.tabset .tabset-pills}

The following link provides some guidance about defining priors.
[https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations]

When defining our own priors, we typically do not want them to be scaled.

If we wanted to define our own priors that were less vague, yet still not likely
to bias the outcomes, we could try the following priors (mainly plucked out of
thin air):

- $\beta_0$: normal centred at 2.3 with a standard deviation of 5 
- $\beta_1$: normal centred at 0 with a standard deviation of 2

Remember the above are applied on the link scale.

I will also overlay the raw data for comparison.

#### ggemmeans

Now lets refit, conditioning on the data.


### Plotting prior and posterior {.tabset .tabset-pills}


**Conclusions:**

- in each case, the prior is substantially wider than the posterior, suggesting
  that the posterior is not biased towards the prior.

## brms {.tabset .tabset-pills}

### Using default priors

In `brms`, the default priors are designed to be weakly informative.  They are
chosen to provide moderate regularisation (to help prevent over-fitting) and
help stabilise the computations.

Unlike `rstanarm`, `brms` models must be compiled before they start sampling.
For most models, the compilation of the stan code takes around 45 seconds.




### Defining priors {.tabset .tabset-pills}

Remember that the priors are applied on the link (in this case, log) scale.

```{r fitModel2d1, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
quinn %>%
    group_by(SEASON, DENSITY) %>%
    summarise(Mean = mean(RECRUITS),
              Median = median(RECRUITS),
              MAD = mad(RECRUITS),
              SD = sd(RECRUITS)) %>%
    mutate(log(Mean),
           log(Median),
           log(MAD),
           log(SD))
```

- $\beta_0$: normal centred at 2.3 with a standard deviation of 1.5
- $\beta_1$: normal centred at 0 with a standard deviation of 1
