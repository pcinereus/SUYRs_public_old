# Scenario

![fanworms](../resources/fanworms.jpg){width="157" height="160"}

In an attempt to understand the effects on marine animals of short-term
exposure to toxic substances, such as might occur following a spill, or
a major increase in storm water flows, a it was decided to examine the
toxicant in question, Copper, as part of a field experiment in Hong
Kong. The experiment consisted of small sources of Cu (small,
hemispherical plaster blocks, impregnated with copper), which released
the metal into sea water over 4 or 5 days. The organism whose response
to Cu was being measured was a small, polychaete worm, Hydroides, that
attaches to hard surfaces in the sea, and is one of the first species to
colonize any surface that is submerged. The biological questions focused
on whether the timing of exposure to Cu affects the overall abundance of
these worms. The time period of interest was the first or second week
after a surface being available.

The experimental setup consisted of sheets of black perspex (settlement
plates), which provided good surfaces for these worms. Each plate had a
plaster block bolted to its centre, and the dissolving block would
create a gradient of [Cu] across the plate. Over the two weeks of the
experiment, a given plate would have plain plaster blocks (Control) or a
block containing copper in the first week, followed by a plain block, or
a plain block in the first week, followed by a dose of copper in the
second week. After two weeks in the water, plates were removed and
counted back in the laboratory. Without a clear idea of how sensitive
these worms are to copper, an effect of the treatments might show up as
an overall difference in the density of worms across a plate, or it
could show up as a gradient in abundance across the plate, with a
different gradient in different treatments. Therefore, on each plate,
the density of worms (\#/cm^2^) was recorded at each of four distances
from the center of the plate.

**COPPER**   Categorical listing of the copper treatment (control = no copper applied, week 2 = copper treatment applied in second week and week 1= copper treatment applied in first week) applied to whole plates. Factor A (between plot factor).
**PLATE**    Substrate provided for polychaete worm colonization on which copper treatment applied. These are the plots (Factor B). Numbers in this column represent numerical labels given to each plate.
**DIST**     Categorical listing for the four concentric distances from the center of the plate (source of copper treatment) with 1 being the closest and 4 the furthest. Factor C (within plot factor)
**WORMS**    Density (\#/cm~2~) of worms measured. Response variable.

# Data preparation



# Exploratory data analysis

Model formula:
$$
y_i \sim{} \mathcal{Pois}(\lambda_i)\\
ln(\lambda_i) =\boldsymbol{\beta} \bf{X_i} + \boldsymbol{\gamma} \bf{Z_i}
$$

where $\boldsymbol{\beta}$ and $\boldsymbol{\gamma}$ are vectors of the fixed and random effects parameters respectively 
and $\bf{X}$ is the model matrix representing the overall intercept and effects of copper, distance and their interaction on the number of number of worms.
Area of the place segment was also incorporated as an offset.
$\bf{Z}$ represents a cell means model matrix for the random intercepts associated with individual plates.

These data are density of worms.  This is not ideal.  It would be
better to have the actual counts along with the area and then model
against a Poisson or Negative Binomial along with having an offset for
area.  Such an approach would allow us to effectively model density
whilst also being able to fit a model with a distribution that closely
matches the data generation process.

Unfortunately, we only have the densities.  As such, our choice of
model families is somewhat restricted.  Out choices are:

- Gaussian: assuming normality etc
- log-normal:
- Gamma with a log link: so long as we can address the presence of zeros in the data
- Tweedie



# Fit the model {.tabset .tabset-faded}

## brms {.tabset .tabset-pills}

### Using default priors

In `brms`, the default priors are designed to be weakly informative.  They are
chosen to provide moderate regularisation (to help prevent over fitting) and
help stabilise the computations.

Unlike `rstanarm`, `brms` models must be compiled before they start sampling.
For most models, the compilation of the stan code takes around 45 seconds.


### Defining priors {.tabset .tabset-pills}

The following link provides some guidance about defining priors.
[https://github.com/stan-dev/stan/wiki/Prior-Choice-Recommendations]

When defining our own priors, we typically do not want them to be scaled.

If we wanted to define our own priors that were less vague, yet still not likely
to bias the outcomes, we could try the following priors (mainly plucked out of
thin air):

- $\beta_0$: normal centred at 3 with a standard deviation of 0.45
  - mean of 3: since `median(log(copper$WORMS+10.125))` or `median(asinh(copper$WORMS/(2*1))/log(exp(1)))`
  - sd of 0.45: since `mad(log(copper$WORMS+0.125))` or `mad(asinh(copper$WORMS/(2*1))/log(exp(1)))`
- $\beta_{1-2}$: normal centred at 0 with a standard deviation of 0.9
  - sd of 0.9: since `mad(log(copper$WORMS+0.125))/model.matrix(~COPPER*DIST, data = copper) %>% apply(2, sd) `
- $\beta_{3-5}$: normal centred at 0 with a standard deviation of 1
  - sd of 1: since `mad(log(copper$WORMS+0.125))/model.matrix(~COPPER*DIST, data = copper) %>% apply(2, sd) `
- $\beta_{6-11}$: normal centred at 0 with a standard deviation of 1.5
  - sd of 1.5: since `mad(log(copper$WORMS+0.125))/model.matrix(~COPPER*DIST, data = copper) %>% apply(2, sd) `
- $\sigma_j$: half-cauchy with parameters 0 and 2.
- $\omega$: gamma with parameters 0.01 and 0.01.
- $\Sigma$: decov with:
  - regularisation: the exponent for a LKJ prior on the correlation matrix.  A
    value of 1 (default) implies a joint uniform prior
  - concentration: the concentration parameter for a symmetric Dirichlet
    distribution.  A value of 1 (default) implies a joint uniform distribution
  - shape and scale: the shape and scale parameters for a gamma prior on the
    scale and scale parameters of the
    decov prior.  A value of 1 for both (default) simplifies the gamma prior to
    a unit-exponential distribution.


#### log-normal




#### Gamma



The above seem sufficiently wide whilst at the same time not providing
any encouragement for the sampler to wander off into very unsupported
areas.



### Plotting prior and posterior

```{r posterior2h2, results='markdown', eval=TRUE}
copper.brm3b %>% get_variables()
copper.brm3b %>% hypothesis('COPPERWeek1=0') %>% plot
copper.brm3b %>% hypothesis('DIST2=0') %>% plot
copper.brm3b %>% SUYR_prior_and_posterior() 
```
