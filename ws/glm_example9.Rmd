# Scenario

To investigate visitor fishing habits in a state park, some wildlife biologists
surveyed the visitors and asked them how many fish they had caught, how many
people were in their group, the number of children in their group and whether
they had brought a camper (caravan) to the park.  As a possible oversight, they
did not ask the visitors whether they had attempted to go fishing and they were
rightly concerned that this might compilate their investigation.

Format of fish.csv data files

CAMPER  CHILD  PERSONS    COUNT
------- --------- ---------- ------
0       0         1          0
1       0         1          0
0       0         1          0

0       0         1          1

**CAMPER**         Categorical listing of whether or not the visitor had brought
                   a camper to the park ­ independent variable
**CHILD**          Categorical listing of the number of children in the
                   visitor's group ­ independent variable
**PERSONS**        The number of people in the visitor's group ­ response variable
**COUNT**          The number of fish the visitor had caught
